    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>I am very communicative. I easily find a thread of communication with a person. I can spend my days doing what I love. During my studies, I not only learned web development, but also learned how to solve problems on my own.
        I know English at upper-intermediate level.</p>
